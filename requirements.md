Allow the user to choose different files to input course/student class

Here are the extra credit things we are doing:

Realize the “cancelling a registered course for the next semester” function. (15 pts) need to fix adding and canceling courses with fileshit. Probably with binary search to remove, and insertion sort to add, rather than using mergesort to fix it every time after.

Use a data structure that you implemented. (For example, an ArrayList-like data structure that’s used to handle courses) (5 pts) FINISHED

Use Merge Sort algorithm while sorting. (10 pts) FINISHED

Use Binary Search algorithm while searching. (5 pts) FINISHED
